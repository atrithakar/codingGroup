This is a repository for the codeforces problems I solve daily. I upload the solutions here. They might not be optimised but they work!
I include the question in code itself. If you have any queries, kindly contact me on my email address atrithaker122@gmail.com.
Also, if you have any problems, kindly email me the problem statement, I'll surely give it a try.
Note: Kindly judge my understanding in coding by looking at my codes before sending me the problem because I am a newbie to the coding world(as of 10-12-2022) and improving myself as time is passing and will improve myself as time will pass.
